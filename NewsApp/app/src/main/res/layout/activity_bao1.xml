That day, most of the 20 attendees were absorbed in their phones: taking photos, sharing them on social media, and waiting for likes and comments from their digital friends. I ended up having the most conversation with a classmate's child, the only one without a phone. 'It’s the same at home; my mom always stares at her phone. She doesn’t play with me,' the child said, pouting in a corner."

            android:text="I was struck by the child’s comment. Spending time with parents is a dream for many children today. As phones become smarter and social media connects people more effectively online, they have ironically driven wedges between family members. Parents might spend more time on their phones than with their children. Some adults spend entire days glued to their screens; some for work, but much of it for the addictive scroll of social media. Many begin their days by updating their digital friends about their night’s sleep instead of greeting their families. These same adults often become agitated when their children use phones in a similar manner. In many families, phones and Internet-connected TVs have become artificial nannies, leaving children vulnerable to influence by digital content creators who may encourage risky or harmful behaviors. At school, teachers sometimes have to confiscate children’s phones, which can lead to resentment. Some children even develop negative attitudes toward their teachers, the schools and studying, just because of their attachment to their phones."

            android:text="Phones also strain family happiness. Many couples spend less time talking to each other and more time scrolling through their devices, leading to a gradual decline in their relationship. This issue isn’t confined to personal spaces. I once worked for a major corporation with strict rules against using phones in meetings. One day, a manager, who is highly capable and with decades of service, checked her phone for less than a minute during a meeting. Later that afternoon, the entire company received an email announcing her dismissal. A momentary lapse with her phone erased decades of contributions. How have phones come to have such a profound impact on society? The simple answer is that we, as a society, allow it. Even though we understand the detrimental effects, many of us compromise our true interests and satisfaction, now closely linked to social media."

Many of us now feel intense anxiety if we leave home without our phones. There’s even a term for this: nomophobia, the fear of being without mobile phone connectivity.
